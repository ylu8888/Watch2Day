# Watch2Day https://watch2day.netlify.app/

Watch2Day is an app that searches for movies and tv shows which can be added/removed from a watchlist.

Purpose: to practice more React, API fetching, and to get familiar with Postman and Bootstrap


Tech Used: 

-Utilized Postman to test and explore the OMDb API, getting access to thousands of movies and tv shows

-Implemented an Add/Remove to Watchlist feature to store movies in local storage

-Utilized async and await for faster processing time when fetching data and state/effect hooks

-Used ReactJS, Bootstrap, Postman, HTML, JSX, CSS and deployed to Netlify
